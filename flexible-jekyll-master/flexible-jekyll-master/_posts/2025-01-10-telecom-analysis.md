### Project Overview
Analyzed 500 customers' behavior for the telecom operator Megaline to determine which of two prepaid plans (Surf or Ultimate) is more profitable for the company.

### Technical Highlights
* **Data Integration:** Processed and merged 5 different datasets containing calls, messages, and internet usage.
* **Statistical Analysis:** Conducted **Hypothesis Testing** (T-tests) to compare average revenues between plans and regions.
* **Key Insight:** Identified that customers in the "Ultimate" plan stay within limits more often, while "Surf" plan users frequently pay for overages.
